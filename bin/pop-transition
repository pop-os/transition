pop-transition is a simple app that notifies users if they have debian versions
of packages which were transitioned to Flatpak in Pop_OS 20.04. 
"""

help = """pop-transition - Migrate deprecated Debian packages to Flatpak.

Usage:
    pop-transition [daemon | check | help ]

    If run without options, pop-transition will open the transition helper 
    window.

Options:
    help, -h
            Display this help message and exit.

    check, -c
            Check for deprecated debian packages and print any that are 
            currently installed. 

    daemon, -d
            Run as a daemon without displaying a window. If there are apps to 
            transition, a notification will be displayed. The daemon will then 
            exit after 10 seconds.
